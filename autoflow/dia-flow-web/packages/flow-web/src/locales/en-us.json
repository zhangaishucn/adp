    "tagExtract.example2": "\tWorks forms a self running workflow by connecting different functions and operation modules together. In order to automate document processing and workflows, we first need to understand the logic of automated flows, which is: automatically executing the specified execution action when the set Trigger Event occurs. There are two fundamental concepts involved here: Trigger and Action.\n\t1. Trigger Event: A Trigger Event is the starting point of an automated workflow, and is used as the starting judgment for whether the automated process is executed based on the state change of the Trigger Event. For example, when uploading a file to the knowledge base, tags are automatically added to the file based on its content. In this case, uploading a file to the knowledge base is the Trigger Event of the process.\n\tCommon Trigger include event triggering, timed triggering, and manual triggering. Below, we will take you to understand the differences and scenarios of these types of Trigger:\n\t① Event triggering: By setting a specified action event as the triggering action. It is generally applicable to scenarios where data creation or change operations need to be performed on files and folders, that is, when selecting the target folder and performing upload, copy, move, or delete actions under that folder, the next step of the operation can be executed. Example: When creating a new folder, automatically add the folder name to the catalog template.\n\t② Timed triggering: By setting specific time periods or time points as Trigger, such as fixed cycles every x hours, every day, or every week. In practical work, there are some tasks that need to be completed at specific times, mainly suitable for scenarios such as message reminders, and the time and frequency of workflow operation can be specified. Example: Automatically remind project leaders to update progress on a weekly basis, regularly backup data to designated folders, etc.\n\t③ Manual triggering: Manual triggering requires you to manually click run after setting up the automation task to trigger the next execution action. Unlike event triggering, manual triggering targets files or folders that have already been uploaded to a certain folder, and then manually clicks to perform the next action. For example, if you have completed writing a planning plan, you can right-click and select it to trigger the workflow, achieving automatic review and publication of the planning plan.\n\t2. Action Event refers to the operation performed after meeting the triggering conditions. If we want the process to execute smoothly as required, we need to set the actions that need to be executed after the process is triggered. A workflow can include multiple operations.\n\tIn addition to the above two items, you can also set execution conditions.\n\tThe execution condition is also known as a logical action, and only when this condition is met will the set operation be executed further. Simply put, it refers to a branch in a workflow, and the running order of the branch is matched from left to right. The process of that branch is only executed when the current branch condition is met. Example: When the content of a file contains \"key information\", the file is classified as confidential; When the keyword is not included in the file content, set the confidentiality level to non confidential.\n\tBy setting up a workflow through \"Trigger Event\", \"Action Event\", and \"branch\", repetitive and simple workflows can be automated!",

    "tagExtract.example3": "\tIn order to make document processing more intelligent, Works has introduced Custom AI，  providing you with the ability to integrate and utilize artificial intelligence in your workflow. By combining Custom AI, workflow has expanded to a richer range of business scenarios. Next, you will learn about Custom AI.\n\tYou can enter Works page and see the Custom AI page. The Custom AI page is used to display the AI models used in the workflow, supporting you in testing, experiencing, creating, and training. Simply put, if the workflow is a two handed process that can input data from one application into another, then Custom AI are its brain that can extract information from data sources. At present, there are many requirements in our workflow. In order to handle unstructured data such as general documents and tables, as well as structured data such as ID cards, business licenses, value-added tax invoices, and train ticket recognition, we have introduced built-in Custom AI into the workflow. The built-in Custom AI provides an out of the box way of use, allowing you to quickly use it in your workflow without the need for collecting sample data, generating, training, and publishing. In order to enable artificial intelligence to understand professional documents, we provide customized Custom AI that require you to upload your own data. Through simple annotation, training, and optimization, you can fine tune and configure it according to your needs based on the basic capabilities. For example, by adding a small number of sample documents, annotating the text information that needs to be extracted, and finally creating Custom AI that are suitable for business scenarios, the trained capabilities can be released and used in the workflow.\n\tThe following are common application scenarios for Custom AI:\n\tFirstly, an important application scenario of Custom AI in workflow is \"text recognition\", which can help you extract text information from documents and images. You can use text recognition to automate the processing of various documents, such as contracts, invoices, resumes, papers, reports, etc. By extracting textual information, you can perform data analysis, archiving, and sharing more quickly, thereby accelerating business processes and improving work efficiency.\n\tSecondly, Custom AI also provide \"tag extraction\" functionality, which utilizes artificial intelligence technology to automatically analyze text and help you extract keywords from the text. You can use the tag extraction function to automatically extract the core tags of documents, enabling faster document classification, storage, retrieval, and management.\n\tOverall, the application scenarios and value of Custom AI in Works are multifaceted. It provides powerful custom Custom AI to help you achieve smarter and more efficient ways of working.",
