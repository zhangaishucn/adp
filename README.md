## Platform Definition

ADP is an intelligent data platform that bridges the gap between heterogeneous data sources and AI agents. It abstracts data complexity through business knowledge networks (Ontology), provides unified data access (VEGA), and orchestrates logic through visual workflows (AutoFlow).

## Key Components

### 1. Ontology Engine
The Ontology Engine is a distributed business knowledge network management system. It allows enterprises to model their business world digitally.
- **Multi-dimensional Modeling**: Define object types, relation types, and action types to map real-world entities.
- **Visual Configuration**: Intuitive interface for ontology management.
- **Intelligent Query**: Supports complex multi-hop relationship path queries and semantic search.

### 2. ContextLoader
ContextLoader is responsible for constructing high-quality context for AI agents.
- **Precise Recall**: Retrieves information based on ontology concepts rather than just keyword matching.
- **Dynamic Assembly**: Assembles context fragments based on the current task needs and user permissions.
- **On-Demand Loading**: Loads only the necessary data to prevent context window overflow.

### 3. VEGA Data Virtualization
VEGA provides a unified SQL interface for heterogeneous data sources, decoupling applications from underlying database implementations.
- **Single Access Point**: Connect to MariaDB, DM8, REST APIs, and more through a single interface.
- **Cross-Source Query**: Join data across different databases seamlessly.
- **Standardized Semantics**: Ensures consistent data definitions across all applications.

### 4. AutoFlow
AutoFlow is a visual workflow orchestration engine designed for humans and agents.
- **Agent Node Embedding**: Embed AI agents as nodes in a workflow to handle complex decision tasks.
- **Low-Code Design**: Drag-and-drop interface for process definition and management.
- **Robust Execution**: Features transaction management, automatic retries, and comprehensive error handling.

## Technical Goals

- **Unified Semantics**: Decouple business logic from code by defining it in the Ontology, allowing for global reuse across agents.
- **Data Agility**: Virtualize data access to avoid hard-coded integrations and enable rapid adaptation to data source changes.
- **Observable Process**: Make all agent actions, data flows, and decisions traceable and auditable.
- **Secure Execution**: Enforce granular permission controls and validation at every step of the data flow.
