**Background:**
Currently, users need to manually refresh the knowledge network after updates.
This feature would automate the refresh process.

**Feature Description:**
Add an auto-refresh mechanism that updates the knowledge network when
underlying data changes.

POST /api/v1/networks/{id}/auto-refresh
{
  "enabled": true,
  "interval": 300
}

**Backward Compatibility:**
This is a new feature and does not affect existing functionality.
```

## 🔀 Pull Request (PR) Process

### 1. Fork the Repository

Fork the repository to your GitHub account.

### 2. Create a Branch

Create a new branch from `main` (or the appropriate base branch):

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**

- `feature/` - for new features
- `fix/` - for bug fixes
- `docs/` - for documentation changes
- `refactor/` - for code refactoring
- `test/` - for adding or updating tests

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, maintainable code
- Follow the project's code structure and architecture patterns
- Add appropriate comments and documentation
- Include standard file headers (see [Source Code Header Guidelines](#-source-code-header-guidelines) below)

### 4. Write Tests

- Add unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests still pass
- Aim for good test coverage

```bash
# Run tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...
```

### 5. Update Documentation

- Update relevant documentation if your changes affect user-facing features
- Update API documentation if you modify endpoints
- Add examples if introducing new functionality
- Update CHANGELOG.md if applicable

#### README Guidelines

When updating README files, please follow these guidelines:

- **Default Language**: `README.md` should be in English (default)
- **Chinese Version**: Chinese documentation should be in `README.zh.md`
- **Keep in Sync**: If you update `README.md`, please also update `README.zh.md` accordingly
- **Structure**: Maintain consistent structure between English and Chinese versions
- **Links**: Update language switcher links at the top of each README file:
  - English: `[中文](README.zh.md) | English`
  - Chinese: `[中文](README.zh.md) | [English](README.md)`

**Example README Structure:**

```markdown
# Project Name

[中文](README.zh.md) | English

[![License](...)](LICENSE.txt)
[![Go Version](...)](...)

Brief description...

## 📚 Quick Links

- Links to documentation, contributing guide, etc.

## Main Content

...
```

### 6. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add auto-refresh for knowledge networks

- Add auto-refresh configuration endpoint
- Implement background refresh worker
- Add tests for refresh functionality

Closes #123"
```

**Commit Message Format:**

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` - A new feature
- `fix:` - A bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### 7. Keep Your Branch Up to Date

Since this project requires linear history, please rebase your branch on the latest `main` branch before pushing:

```bash
# Make sure you're on your feature branch
git checkout feature/my-feature

# Ensure all changes are committed
git status  # Check for uncommitted changes

# If you have uncommitted changes, commit them first:
# git add .
# git commit -m "your commit message"

# Option 1: If you have upstream configured, fetch and rebase on upstream/main
# git fetch upstream
# git rebase upstream/main

# Option 2: Fetch latest changes from origin and rebase on origin/main
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# If there are conflicts, resolve them and continue:
# 1. Fix conflicts in the affected files
# 2. git add <resolved-files>
# 3. git rebase --continue

# If you want to abort the rebase:
# git rebase --abort

# Force push (required after rebase)
git push origin feature/my-feature --force-with-lease
```

> **Note**:
>
> - Use `--force-with-lease` instead of `--force` to avoid overwriting others' work.
> - Make sure you're on your feature branch before rebasing.
> - If you prefer to track the upstream repository, you can add it: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/kweaver-ai/kweaver.git`

## 📝 Source Code Header Guidelines

This section defines the standard source code file header used across **kweaver.ai** open-source projects.

The goal is to ensure:

- clear copyright ownership
- clear licensing (Apache License 2.0)
- consistent and readable file documentation

> **Note**: We use "The kweaver.ai Authors" instead of individual author names.
> Git history already tracks all contributors, and this approach is easier to maintain.

### Standard Header (Go / C / Java)

Use the following header for all core source files:

```go
// Copyright The kweaver.ai Authors.
//
// Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
// See the LICENSE file in the project root for details.
```

### Language-Specific Variants

#### Python

```python
# Copyright The kweaver.ai Authors.
#
# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
# See the LICENSE file in the project root for details.
```

#### JavaScript / TypeScript

```ts
/**
 * Copyright The kweaver.ai Authors.
 *
 * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
 * See the LICENSE file in the project root for details.
 */
```

#### Shell

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Copyright The kweaver.ai Authors.
# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
# See the LICENSE file in the project root for details.
```

#### HTML / XML

```html
<!--
  Copyright The kweaver.ai Authors.
  Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
  See the LICENSE file in the project root for details.
-->
```

### Derived or Forked Files (Optional)

If a file was originally derived from another project, you may add an origin note
after the license header (for key files only):

```go
// Copyright The kweaver.ai Authors.
//
// Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
// See the LICENSE file in the project root for details.
//
// This file is derived from [original-project](https://github.com/org/repo)
```

This is optional but recommended for transparency and community trust.

### Scope

Headers are **recommended** for:

- core logic and business code
- public APIs and interfaces
- libraries and SDKs
- CLI tools and utilities

Headers are **optional** for:

- unit tests and test fixtures
- examples and demos
- generated files (protobuf, OpenAPI, etc.)
- configuration files (YAML, JSON, TOML)
- documentation files (Markdown, etc.)

### Why No Individual Author Names?

Following the practice of major open-source projects (Kubernetes, TensorFlow, etc.):

- **Git history** already provides a complete and accurate record of all contributors
- Individual author lists are **hard to maintain** and often become outdated
- Using "The kweaver.ai Authors" ensures **consistent attribution** across all files
- Contributors are recognized through the project's **CONTRIBUTORS** file and git log

### License Requirement

All repositories **must** include a `LICENSE` file containing the full text of
the Apache License, Version 2.0.

### Guiding Principle

> If a file is expected to be reused, forked, or maintained long-term,
> it deserves a clear and explicit header.
