# Ontology Engine

[中文](README.zh.md) | English

## Project Overview

The Ontology Engine is a distributed business knowledge network management system developed in Go, providing ontology modeling, data management, and intelligent query capabilities. The system adopts a microservices architecture, divided into ontology management and ontology query modules, supporting the construction, storage, and querying of large-scale knowledge networks.

As a core component of the KWeaver AI platform, the Ontology Engine focuses on building enterprise-level business knowledge networks, enabling business knowledge modeling, storage, querying, and application. The system follows clean architecture principles and SOLID design, offering excellent scalability and maintainability.

### Ontology Manager Module (ontology-manager)

Responsible for creating, editing, and managing ontology models. Main features include:

- **Knowledge Network Management**: Build and manage business knowledge networks
- **Object Type Management**: Define and manage object types in knowledge networks
- **Relation Type Management**: Define and manage relation types in knowledge networks
- **Action Type Management**: Define executable operations and actions
- **Job Scheduling**: Background task and job management

### Ontology Query Module (ontology-query)

Provides efficient knowledge graph query services. Main features include:

- **Model Query**: Query and browse ontology models
- **Graph Query**: Complex relationship path queries
- **Semantic Search**: Semantic-based intelligent search
- **Data Retrieval**: Multi-dimensional data filtering and retrieval

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Go**: 1.24.0 or higher
- **Database**: MariaDB 11.4+ or DM8 (for data storage)
- **Search Engine**: OpenSearch 2.x (for search and indexing)
- **Dependency Services**: Requires other KWeaver platform services
- **Docker**: Optional, for containerized deployment
- **Kubernetes**: Optional, for cluster deployment

### Local Development

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kweaver-ai/adp.git
cd adp/ontology
```

#### 2. Configure environment

Each module has its own configuration file that needs to be configured according to the actual environment:

```yaml
# Ontology Manager configuration
ontology-manager/server/config/ontology-manager-config.yaml

# Ontology Query configuration
ontology-query/server/config/ontology-query-config.yaml
```

**Key configuration items**:
- Database connection information (host, port, user, password)
- OpenSearch connection information
- Dependency service addresses (user-management, data-model, etc.)
- Service port configuration

#### 3. Initialize database

```bash
# Execute database initialization scripts
# MariaDB
mysql -u root -p < ontology-manager/migrations/mariadb/6.0.0/pre/init.sql

# DM8
disql SYSDBA/SYSDBA@localhost:5236 < ontology-manager/migrations/dm8/6.0.0/pre/init.sql
```

#### 4. Run the Ontology Manager module

```bash
cd ontology-manager/server
go mod download
go run main.go
```

The service will start at `http://localhost:13014`

**Health Check**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:13014/health
```

#### 5. Run the Ontology Query module

```bash
cd ../ontology-query/server
go mod download
go run main.go
```

The service will start at `http://localhost:13018`

**Health Check**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:13018/health
```

### Docker Deployment

#### Build images

```bash
# Build Ontology Manager module
cd ontology-manager
docker build -t ontology-manager:latest -f docker/Dockerfile .

# Build Ontology Query module  
cd ../ontology-query
docker build -t ontology-query:latest -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

#### Run containers

```bash
# Run Ontology Manager module
docker run -d -p 13014:13014 --name ontology-manager ontology-manager:latest

# Run Ontology Query module
docker run -d -p 13018:13018 --name ontology-query ontology-query:latest
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

The project provides Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment:

```bash
# Deploy Ontology Manager module
